The array is filled with objects that contain the \"propName\"s\r\n\t *  as specified by the columns prop\r\n\t *  - columns: An array of object containing information about each of the columns in the table. Each object should\r\n\t *  contain the following:\r\n\t *    - propName: The name of the prop that the column will use when searching for the value\r\n\t *    - colTitle: The title at the top of the column\r\n\t *    - style: (Optional) Object of styles properties for the cells of the column (optional)\r\n\t *    - editable: (Optional) Boolean that determines whether or not the property is editable. Defaults to false\r\n\t *    - hiddenInTable: (Optional) Boolean that determines whether or not the property is hidden in the table.\r\n\t *    Defaults to false\r\n\t *    - hiddenInEditZone: (Optional) Boolean that determines whether or not the property is hidden in the edit\r\n\t *    zone. Defaults to false\r\n\t *    - textarea: (Optional) Boolean that determines whether or not the input field will be a textarea. Defaults to\r\n\t *    false\r\n\t *    - isBoolean: (Optional) Boolean that determines whether or not the value is a boolean. Defaults to false\r\n\t *    - validator: (Optional) Function to run to test if the value provided for this column is correctly validated.\r\n\t *    If the value returned by this function is true, the value is valid and not if otherwise. If the value returned\r\n\t *    is a string, that string will be shown as an error message. Takes an object as a parameter with the\r\n\t *    following properties:\r\n\t *      - newValue: The new value\r\n\t *      - oldValue: The old value\r\n\t *      - newObject: The object containing all the new values after change\r\n\t *      - oldObject: The object containing all the old value before change\r\n\t *      - data: The rest of the data\r\n\t *\r\n\t * It also has a few optional props:\r\n\t *  - noAdd: Boolean which, if set to true, forbids the addition of new rows. Note that if noChange is set to true,\r\n\t *  adding is already disabled\r\n\t *  - noDelete: Boolean which, if set to true, forbids the deletion of rows\r\n\t *  - onDelete: Function to run when the delete button for a row is pressed. It takes the row object as its only\r\n\t *  parameter and if false is returned, it will cancel the deletion of the row. If a string is returned, it will\r\n\t *  also chancel the deletion, but this string will act as an error message\r\n\t *  - noChange: Boolean which, if set to true, forbids the modification of any row in the table\r\n\t *  - onChange: Function to run when the confirm button for a row is pressed. It take two parameters:\r\n\t *    - newObj: The new row object\r\n\t *    - oldObj: The old row object.
